Concerning the format:

At some point, all recordings were assigned a tape number.

Later, all tapes were digitized and stored as WAV file. Section markers were added to those WAV files using Sound Forge. Sound Forge writes markers into wav files as standard WAV cue points. Cue points were inserted at the start of each track, but not at the end. Thus, for each track the end point was the start of next track, or the end of the file. Section marking in this way was done for most, but not all, of the tapes. Tape WAV files were then stored on CDs. Each CD could hold several tapes. Each CD was assigned a number.
Seven tapes were lost before digitization: 37, 72, 96, 132, 139, 140, 191.

Track numbering begins normally begins with 1, but on certain tapes that have long speech as introductions, the introduction section is numbered as track 0.

Certain tapes had multiple parts (marked with a, b, g). How the parts are named, and how the tracks are numbered across parts, are inconsistent.
Examples: 
tape 14 is divided into 14a and 14b. On each part, track numbering is started from the beginning.
tape 35 is divided into 35a (tracks 1-18) and 35b (tracks 19-26). 
tape 213 is divided into 213, 213a, 213b, and 213g. On each part, track numbering is started from the beginning.
tape 45 is divided into 45a and 45bg (it seems that initially 45 was to be split into three parts, but parts 2 and 3 were combined, hence "bg"). On each part, track numbering is started from the beginning.
tape 169 is divided into 169a (tracks 1-16) and 169 (track 17).
tape 196 is listed as 196a. There is no record of any other part of tape 196.

During the process of creating a digital catalog describing the contents of the audio files in the corpus, initially each individual section was assigned a number. Later, the following reference format was adopted instead:
"kd{three-digit representation of CD number}, ef{three-digit representation of the tape number}-{track number, sometimes but not always with a leading zero}"

E.g. "kd042, ef196a-3" can be deciphered as CD 42, tape 196a, track 3.

For most tape WAVs, there were exactly as many markers in the WAV file as there were tracks described in the digital catalog, and the order of the in the catalog matched the numbering of cues as recorded in the WAV file (not necessarily sequentially, e.g cue 5 can come before cue 3).

kd stands for "kompakt disk" (CD). "ef" stands for "eqspeditsiebis fondi" (expedition collection; there were three other collections - tele-radio, central archive, and private; there are stored separately and not included in the corpus of field recordings).

The digital catalog contained some entries with codes beginning with "kf" instead of "kd". This was a typo. The catalog also contains entries with codes that begin with "kd{three-digit representation of CD number}d.," 

The digital catalog was stored as a Microsoft Access database file (MDB), with custom software "DS_Folklore_2M" for managing the data and adding entries. The process of data entry was stopped at some point, possibly in 2019. No data is available in the catalogue for tapes starting with 205, with the exception of tapes 210-213. In addition, tape 54 was skipped during data entry despite not being missing.

Contents of the latest version of the catalog in json form are present in data.json. The contents have not been altered, and include the mistakes from the original. A second file, "data_update.json", is used for our additions and corrections to the catalogue.

Issues:

Lost tapes: 
    37, 72, 96, 132, 139, 140, 191

Individual tracks not found:
    21-15 (missing from uncut tape digitization/tape itself; possibly a stray that just got into the directory for split tape 21 at some point and was incorrectly recorded as part of tape 21).

Uncatalogued tapes:
    54, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 214, 215, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230

Directories:
    tapes: contains a directory for each tape. Each directory contains individual tracks of the tape. In addi;tion, tapes directory contains text files generated by process_tape_data.py describing missing materials.
        For individual tracks already cut in the Conservatoire, our copies are identical, with the following exception:
            Tape 13, track 1-2: those two tracks were present in a single split audio file, despite being listed separately in the catalogue. As such, we separated them into individual files manually.
    uncut: contains a directory for each tape for which an uncut WAV file is accessible to us. Note: Certain uncut WAV files available to us have been modified and are distinct from the ones held in the Tbilisi State Conservatoire. The changes are in the markers: they have been corrected to match the track splits found in the catalogue. The only alteration to the actual audio content was for one track section on one tape, for which the original's audio contents were reversed.


13-1, 13-2
115-12, 115-13

Scripts:
process_tape_data: attempts to match each item in the catalogue with an audio file in subdirectories of tapes directory. This script produces the following outputs and places them in tapes directory:
    track_file_dict.json: JSON file containing a mapping of catalogue item codes to audio files.
    missing_items.txt: list of items for which there is an entry in the catalogue, but for which no matching audio file could be found despite the item's tape directory being available. For each such item, tape number, track number, catalogue code, and track name are provided.
    missing_tapes.txt: list of tapes for which entries exist in the catalogue but for which there is no tape directory. There are no such tapes.
    uncatalogued_missing_tapes.txt: list of tapes for which there is neither a catalogue entry nor a tape directory. All seven of such tapes are lost.
    uncatalogued_non_missing_tapes.txt: list of tapes for which there is a tape directory but for which there are no entries in the catalogue.
split_uncut_files.py: splits some or all (depending on an inline setting within the script) of the uncut audio files present in subdirectories of uncut directory according to WAV cue markers (with hardcoded exceptions post-processing rules for certain tapes), and places the outputs in the corresponding tapes subdirectory. If the tapes subdirectory for a tape already exists, it is first deleted.
